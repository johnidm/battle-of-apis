# Batle of REST APIs

What exacly is Batle of REST APIs? 

Is a way I find to have a fun time writing code in different program languages using differents frameworks.

Writing APIs REST is a commun role for any software engineer. 

In this repo, I try to make my best code building different REST APIs projects.

How the REST APIs works:
	- Management customer data by CRUD operations.
	- Control create and debit with amount, and limit. 
	- Provide a report about all transctions.

I am using nginx to provide a HTTP load balancer.

## Commands

#### Running the project

```bash
docker compose up --build
```
